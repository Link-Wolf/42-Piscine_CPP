<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<div align="center">
  <a>
    <img src="assets/cpp.png" alt="cpp logo">
  </a>
</div>
</br>

There are 9 different small C++ projects which aim to teach us all basic C++ concepts step by step</br>
For this projects, the code should comply with C++98 standard (compile with `-std=c++98` flag)</br>
So C++11 and `Boost` libraries are forbidden, as well as `*printf()`, `*alloc()` and `free()` functions to use as much as possible the C++-ish versions of the C functions

Here are all the C++ concepts discussed :

-   Namespaces, classes, member functions, `stdio` streams, static, const
-   Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, `switch` statement
-   Polymorphism, operator overloading and canonical form
-   Inheritance
-   Polymorphism by sub-typing, abstract classes, interfaces
-   Exceptions
-   C++ casts
-   Templates
-   Containers templates, iterators, algorithms

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Because they're simple C++ programs, there isn't much to say here

### Prerequisites

Having a C++ compiler like c++

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Link-Wolf/42-Piscine_CPP.git
    ```
2. Compile one of the exercice, in one of the sub-projects
    ```sh
    cd 42-Piscine_CPP/Cpp0X/exXX; make
    ```
3. Execute the program
    ```sh
    ./exXX
    ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Test differents exercices in differents sub-projects and have fun..i guess ?

#### Example

```sh
   your_terminal$  ./ex01
```

#### Output

```

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

-   [ ] Make a better and more detailed readme (for each sub-project ?)

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Link-Wolf/42-Piscine_CPP/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
